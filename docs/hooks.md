# React hooks
Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks allows hooking into React features, such as **state** and **[lifecycle](lifecycle.md)** methods.

Rules of using hooks:
1. Hooks can only be called inside React functional components.
2. Hooks can only be called on the top level of the component.
3. Hooks cannot be conditional.

*Note: Hooks doesn't work in React class components.*

## ~ # JSX
JSX is a special syntax which stands for **JavaScript XML**. JSX has similar syntax as HTML but it's possible to combine JavaScript code inside it. Here is a example of JSX:

```jsx
function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Hello {name}</h1>
        </div>
    );
}
```

In this example HTML like syntax is JSX code and the **{name}** is a JavaScript expression.
